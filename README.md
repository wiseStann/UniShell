# UniShell
### TODO
* Auto-completion;
* Ability to integrate UniShell into other C program products;

### UniShell is an analogue of the Unix-like systems shell.
#### UniShell provides:
* multiprocessing;
* standard streams redirection;
* Unix-like systems commands;
* shell history;
* characters insertion (perhaps it's not a feature, but i just put it here);
* many many more.
